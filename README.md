# qumran_ink_segmentation_using_multipectral_pixel_values_clustering
This project focuses on segmenting ink in Dead Sea Scroll fragments by clustering multispectral pixel values.

It constructs a multispectral image cube from this [folder](). It reads the 12 `.tif` image files in the folder, crops the images to a specified region (defined by coordinates `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`), and stacks them along the first dimension to create the image cube.
